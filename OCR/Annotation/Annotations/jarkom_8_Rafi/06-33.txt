Multimedia: video
video: sequence of images displayed at constant rate
e.g., 24 images/sec
digital image: array of pixels
each pixel represented by bits
coding: use redundancy within and between images to decrease # bits used to encode image
spatial (within image)
temporal (from one image to next)
spatial coding example: instead of sending N values of same color (all purple), send only two values: color  value (purple)  and number of repeated values (N)
