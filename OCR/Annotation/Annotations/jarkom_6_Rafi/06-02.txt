Thinking about the DNS
humongous distributed database:
~ billion records, each simple
handles many trillions of queries/day:
many more reads than writes
performance matters:  almost every Internet transaction interacts with DNS - msecs count!
organizationally, physically decentralized:
millions of different organizations responsible for their records
“bulletproof”: reliability, security
