INSERT
Another variation of INSERT allows insertion of multiple tuples resulting from a query into a relation
U3A: CREATE TABLE DEPTS_INFO
(DEPT_NAME VARCHAR(10),
NO_OF_EMPS INTEGER,
TOTAL_SAL INTEGER);
U3B: INSERT INTO DEPTS_INFO (DEPT_NAME,
NO_OF_EMPS, TOTAL_SAL)
SELECT DNAME, COUNT (*), SUM (SALARY)
FROM DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE
WHERE DNUMBER = DNO
GROUP BY DNAME ;
