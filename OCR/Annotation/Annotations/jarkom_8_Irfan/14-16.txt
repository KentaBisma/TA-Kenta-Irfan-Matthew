Streaming multimedia: DASH
Dynamic, Adaptive Streaming over HTTP
server:
divides video file into multiple chunks
each chunk encoded at multiple different rates
different rate encodings stored in different files
files replicated in various CDN nodes
manifest file: provides URLs for different chunks
client:
periodically estimates server-to-client bandwidth
consulting manifest, requests one chunk at a time
chooses maximum coding rate sustainable given current bandwidth
can choose different coding rates at different points in time (depending on available bandwidth at time), and from different servers
