Socket programming with UDP UDP: no “connection” between client and server: no handshaking before sending data sender explicitly attaches IP destination address and port # to each packet receiver extracts sender IP address and port# from received packet UDP: transmitted data may be lost or received out-of-order Application viewpoint: UDP provides unreliable transfer of groups of bytes (“datagrams”) between client and server processes
