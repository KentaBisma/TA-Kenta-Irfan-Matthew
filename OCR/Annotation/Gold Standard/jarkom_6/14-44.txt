Caching DNS Information once (any) name server learns mapping, it caches mapping, and immediately returns a cached mapping in response to a query caching improves response time cache entries timeout (disappear) after some time (TTL) TLD servers typically cached in local name servers cached entries may be out-of-date if named host changes IP address, may not be known Internet-wide until all TTLs expire! best-effort name-to-address translation!
